Testing
=======
Unit tests are provided for the objects you will be working on. You can run them
from the project directory using::

    pytest

You can also run specific tests using the filename::

    pytest tests/test_box.py

or selecting by keyword with the ``-k`` optiion::

    pytest -k "box"

Initially, all tests will fail! You will need to implement the details of these
objects in order to get the tests to pass.
